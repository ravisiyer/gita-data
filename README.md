## 🙏 What is the Bhagavad Gita
- The Bhagavad Gita is one of the most prominent Hindu texts, forming a part of the Indian epic known as Mahabharata. 
- Originally written in Sanskrit, the Bhagavad Gita is believed to have been composed between the 5th and 2nd century BCE.
- It is a guidebook to lead an enjoyable and blissful life. In other words, it is a user’s manual to lead a meaningful human life
- Lord Krishna imparted this knowledge to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kurukshetra, when the latter was in a distressful condition
- Upon receiving this knowledge returned to his happy and stable position
- All of us undergo difficult situations in life and often become overwhelmed by those situations not knowing where to find a solution
- The Bhagavad-Gita guides us out of such delusions and reestablishes us in our original position of eternity, knowledge and bliss
- If we follow the instructions as given by Lord Krishna, then we can attain the same blissful state as Arjuna did

## 🌸 How relevant is it in modern times
- The Bhagavad-gita is manual given by the Supreme Lord Krishna which guides us in making the best use of this human life and to deriving real happiness from it.
- In the modern times when people are more confused and misdirected, the Gita become all the more relevant for the individual as well as the society at large in bringing back the stability and happiness in life.
